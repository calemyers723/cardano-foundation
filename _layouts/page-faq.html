                      <p>Cardano is a next-generation blockchain platform, more advanced than any protocol yet developed, and the first to evolve out of a scientific philosophy. Built by a large international team of expert engineers and researchers, Cardano is founded upon peer-reviewed academic research.</p>
                      <p>The Cardano platform allows provably secure transfers of value whilst balancing the needs of regulators with those of consumer privacy and protection. We aim to bring maturity, security and transparency to an industry that will require them to thrive. For applications that require regulatory interface, we provide the tools to manage the interactions with the incentive of provable security.</p>
                      <p>The platform is being built in stages, with intentional separation between settlement and computation. The value token ADA is the native cryptocurrency on the settlement layer expected to launch and be tradable on exchanges in May 2017. The computation layer is currently scheduled for launch in early 2018.</p>

                      <p>The Cardano project was initiated by a group of cryptocurrency enthusiasts, investors and entrepreneurs concentrated in Asia at the end of 2014. <a href="https://iohk.io/projects/cardano/"> Input Output HK</a> (IOHK) was engaged to design and implement the Cardano protocol. In addition, the <a href="https://cardanofoundation.org/"> Cardano Foundation</a>, based in Switzerland, was created to help oversee and supervise the development of Cardano and its ecosystem, and to advocate on behalf of the users of the protocol. Another entity, the <a href="http://cardano.io/"> Cardano Group</a>, based in the Isle of Man, was created to pursue for-profit activities on behalf of the ecosystem and community. The three entities are wholly separate in ownership and leadership. Lastly, the <a href="http://attaincorp.co.jp/en/"> Attain Corporation</a>, was given sole rights to distribute and perform the token presale.</p>

                              <p>The <strong>Cardano Foundation</strong> acts as a supervisory and educational body for the protocol, and as such we have a number of roles and responsibilities. We aim to educate and promote the Cardano protocol, fostering a community of engaged parties and acting as an information hub. Through contacts with authorities we hope to influence blockchain regulation, which will be critical for the long-term success of the platform. Finally, we will aid the creation of formal software standards for Cardano, a crucial feature for a protocolâ€™s long-term success and critical in enterprise adoption and government engagement.</p>

                              <p>IOHK is a world-class engineering and research company that has developed a huge amount of capabilities, from setting up research centres, to hiring the best scientists in the field and well over a dozen Haskell developers, including one of the creators of Haskell. They have brought in very highly regarded firms, Well Typed and FP Complete, to review the Cardano code, to give the very highest assurances of security, adopting a first principles approach in building the software stack.</p>
                              <p>IOHK is contracted to design, build, and maintain the platform through to 2020. In 2017 the focus will be on the settlement layer, and 2018 the focus will be on the control layer. In 2019 IOHK will concentrate on long-term maintenance, scalability, sustainability, and 2020 will be focused on finessing the technology already built.</p>

As most of the business facing applications are dependent on the computation layer (set for release in 2018), CGG will focus first on establishing infrastructure, and once the ecosystem is ready for venture applications, staff teams and deploy resources.</p>
                              <p>CGG is currently establishing key research and development centers in the target geographies such as the Philippines and South Korea. CGG will deploy capital and resources in two ways. First, it will build from a foundational level by identifying, aiding, and investing in early stage blockchain companies building on the Cardano technology stack. Second, from a growth standpoint CGG will invest in subsidiaries focusing on industry specific verticals and create new for-profit ventures to consult, educate, and integrate mature companies into the Cardano blockchain stack.</p>
