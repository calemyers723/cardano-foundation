Cardano Foundation would like to take this opportunity to improve the community understanding on affiliations, representations and use of trademarks.<!--break-->

As Cardano Foundation, one of our key responsibilities is to protect the Cardano brand and trademark. It is crucial to strike the right balance between an open source philosophy and the need to actively protect the Cardano brand.

Recent global recognition of the project has meant a clear policy for its use is is important to protect our community and commercial ecosystem. In doing so we seek to nurture a fertile and robust environment for participation and innovation to thrive.

Cardano Foundation has already secured a significant number of Cardano related trademarks for this project, including the Cardano name, exploding star logo and Ada symbol in Switzerland many countries. During this process, it quickly became clear that the Trademark for the word ‘Cardano’ was already secured and used by a party covering the EU (including UK) and the USA. Especially in these territories we advise our community and all parties to act with caution and in full respect to the rights of the trademark holder.

In light of the above, given Cardano’s efforts were initially Asia focussed and considering the long term objective was to create an international and decentralised open source technology, the project did not deem it necessary amend it’s Cardano name.

As the project has gone from strength to strength, global awareness has skyrocketed. There are now widespread references and representations about the Cardano protocol name and logo in the public domain and this will only continue to gain momentum.

We are often asked questions by our community as to exactly what representations can be made using Cardano and associated branding; it is not an easy question to answer, especially given the complexity around other trademarks globally. We are aware of these requests and we continue to work on it. Because Cardano must meet the requirement of a modern decentralized and open project, we have to develop the right balance between the ‘old trademark world’ and its advantages in addition to those of the brand new and somewhat unexplored blockchain world with its trademarks’ challenges in a decentralised and open source environment.

What we can do now is state our general philosophy which we hope our community will align with:

Cardano was founded as a gift to the world. To empower the individual, not to improve the status quo towards existing centres of power and wealth. Public blockchain technology has the potential to deliver individuals the choice to trade with who they want, when they want, how they want and we want to kickstart this peer-to-peer economic revolution.

At the same time, Cardano must stand for transparency and use its every power to prevent fraud, misrepresentation and uncertainty. To protect those same individuals.
So what does this mean in practical terms?

Firstly, we are busy drafting a fair use trademarks policy; this is not as straightforward as it might seem considering the global nature of the project and the territory based nature of the trademarks. We ask our community for a little more patience to get this right.

Secondly, the spirit of the trademark fair use policy will be aligned with open source philosophy, allowing people to report, promote and innovate on behalf of the project.

Thirdly, striking the proper balance between liberating these emerging community requirements for a trademark policy, and, on the other hand securing the brand and project for the benefit of the community requires a common understanding from all three founding partners; Cardano Foundation, IOHK and Emurgo. The main guidelines within such a policy will not only be clarification for the community and world at large, but also clear advice for all three of these parties so that together we align approach and strategy, for the greater benefit of our Cardano decentralised ecosystem. Each party will face choices to enter partnerships or make affiliations and representations they feel will benefit the project. On our part we will not always be party to our partners agreements, nor them to ours, with these guidelines in place we can have faith in each other to perform the necessary due diligence that these will serve to strengthen the project further.

Finally, we will seek to quash fraud and misrepresentations in the public domain and ask our community to alert us to malpractice.

In closing, we are working on publishing a fair use trademarks policy, this is a detailed and complex issue subject to legal approval and alignment with all project partners. We will issue this policy in the near future and provide regular updates on progress made.
