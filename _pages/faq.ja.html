                  <p>Cardano is a next-generation blockchain platform, more advanced than any protocol yet developed, and the first to evolve out of a scientific philosophy.</p>
                  <p>Built by a large international team of expert engineers and researchers, Cardano is founded upon peer-reviewed academic research.</p>
                  <p>The Cardano platform allows provably secure transfers of value whilst balancing the needs of regulators with those of consumer privacy and protection.</p>
                  <p>We aim to bring maturity, security and transparency to an industry that will require them to thrive.</p>
                  <p>For applications that require regulatory interface, we provide the tools to manage the interactions with the incentive of provable security.</p>

                  <p>A blockchain is a database that is stored, maintained, and controlled by a network in contrast to traditional databases which are operated by a central or trusted third party. Blockchain technology makes it possible to create a digital record of events such as a financial transaction, sending a message, or exchanging the deed to property without any verification from a trusted third party. Instead, the network’s many participants ensure that tampering and malicious behavior cannot occur because all the transactions are verified by the entire network, meanwhile the information is encrypted so that users do not sacrifice privacy or security.</p>

                  <p>The Cardano Foundation acts as a supervisory and educational body for the protocol, and as such we have a number of roles and responsibilities. We aim to educate and promote the Cardano protocol, fostering a community of engaged parties and acting as an information hub. Through contacts with authorities we hope to influence blockchain regulation, which will be critical for the long-term success of the platform. Finally, we will aid the creation of formal software standards for Cardano, a crucial feature for a protocol’s long-term success and critical in enterprise adoption and government engagement.</p>

                  <p>IOHK is a world-class engineering and research company that has developed a huge amount of capabilities, from setting up research centres, to hiring the best scientists in the field and well over a dozen Haskell developers, including one of the creators of Haskell. They have brought in very highly regarded firms, Well Typed and FP Complete, to review the Cardano code, to give the very highest assurances of security, adopting a first principles approach in building the software stack. IOHK is contracted to design, build, and maintain the platform through to 2020. In 2017 the focus will be on the settlement layer, and 2018 the focus will be on the control layer. In 2019 IOHK will concentrate on long-term maintenance, scalability, sustainability, and 2020 will be focused on finessing the technology already built.</p>

                  <p>Emurgo is an investment focused entity that will build and foster commercial applications in the ecosystem and promoting Cardano blockchain technology usage. As most of the business facing applications are dependent on the computation layer (set for release in 2018), Emurgo will focus first on establishing infrastructure, and once the ecosystem is ready for venture applications, staff teams and deploy resources. Emurgo is currently establishing key research and development centers in the target geographies such as the Philippines and South Korea. Emurgo will deploy capital and resources in two ways. First, it will build from a foundational level by identifying, aiding, and investing in early stage blockchain companies building on the Cardano technology stack. Second, from a growth standpoint Emurgo will invest in subsidiaries focusing on industry specific verticals and create new for-profit ventures to consult, educate, and integrate mature companies into the Cardano blockchain stack.</p>

                  <p>Deadalus is a wallet, developed by IOHK which will allow you to store Ada. Deadalus is a Hierarchical Deterministic (HD) wallet, allowing you to create an infinite set of keys from a single seed. Whenever you want to move your wallet, you will only need to enter your seed and the HD algorithm will find all your ADA. This means you will never have to worry about managing lots of seeds or files of keys. You can find out more information about Deadalus by going to: <a href="https://test.daedaluswallet.io/">https://test.daedaluswallet.io/</a>.
